            <h1>Intelligent Domestic Environments for Diverse Age Groups</h1>


            <div>
              <h2>1. Problem Identification</h2>
              <p>
                In the realm of scientific and technological progress, intelligent domestic environments are increasingly prevalent. However, a critical issue is their lack of age-specific functionality, especially affecting the elderly who struggle with smart home systems due to declining cognitive and sensory abilities. This problem is exacerbated in environments where system demands exceed elderly users' capabilities. Similarly, children using these systems often face challenges that could hinder their development. It's essential to develop intelligent environments tailored to the unique needs of both older adults and children, focusing on safety, assistance, and convenience to enhance their well-being and development.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>2. Literature Review</h2>
              <h3>2.1 For the Senior Age Group</h3>
              <p>
                The adoption of intelligent domestic environments hinges on user-centric factors, notably age and technology experience. There's a marked gap between the expected and actual market adoption of intelligent furniture for seniors, largely due to complex interfaces that overwhelm elderly users, leading to frustration and disengagement. Recognizing this, the industry is shifting towards intuitive, behavior-centric design, facilitated by advances in sensor and wireless technologies. This shift aims to create environments that align with seniors' behavioral patterns and sensory needs, enhancing their independence and interaction with their surroundings. The focus is on making smart homes more accessible and beneficial for the elderly.
              </p>
              <h3>2.2 For the Pre-school Age Group</h3>
              <p>
                Early childhood literature emphasizes the importance of parental involvement in cognitive and social development, but notes a decline due to digital distractions. This leads to behavioral issues in children, as parents often overlook underlying causes. Intelligent domestic systems designed for preschoolers' needs can remedy this by fostering educational parent-child interactions and nurturing learning environments. These systems are crucial in enhancing early development and strengthening family education, particularly in senior and children-focused smart furniture design.

              <h2>4. Design Implications and Outcomes</h2>
              <img src="img_2.png">
              <p>Intelligent domestic systems tailored to pre-schoolers can significantly enhance early childhood development by fostering a learning-rich environment and improving the parent-child relationship through educational engagement. These systems address the educational engagement gap and support a stimulating home atmosphere, thereby reinforcing the foundation of family education. Focusing on the unique needs of both seniors and children, smart furniture systems are vital, particularly since a significant part of their routines happens at home. User capability is a crucial factor in designing these systems, ensuring they serve and adapt to the varying needs effectively.

              <p>
                <h4>1) <strong>SR (Sufficient Range) Capacity</strong></h4>
              <p>
                In the SR capacity range, user proficiency exceeds the functional demands of the product,
                ensuring ease of use and clarity. While this simplicity is beneficial for user comprehension and
                reduces development costs, it may also inadvertently result in user disengagement due to the
                monotony of the experience. Products that fall within this range risk being relegated to mere
                utilities rather than engaging, enriching elements of daily life.
              </p>

              <h4>2) <strong>MR (Matching Range) Ability</strong></h4>
              <p>
                The MR represents a balance between the user's operational capabilities and the product's
                functionalities, situated between the minimal S values and optimal M values. This equilibrium
                fosters an engaging and motivating user experience, encouraging exploration and sustained
                interaction. Products within this range typically offer advanced features that enhance daily living,
                representing an ideal focus for research and development. This alignment maximizes user
                satisfaction and amplifies the perceived value of the product.
              </p>

              <h4>3) <strong>IR (Insufficient Range) Capacity</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Conversely, the IR capacity range denotes a discordance where the user's abilities are
                substantially lower than the product's functionalities, leading to user frustration and a diminished
                experience. The disparity can result in negative emotional responses and a reluctance to use the
                product, necessitating a reevaluation of the product’s complexity relative to the user’s
                capabilities.
              </p>

              <img src="img_1.png">
              <p>To address user recognition, intelligent furniture systems must implement real-time identification and adaptation mechanisms, using a cloud-based application to personalize interactions based on each user's age and abilities. A data-centric approach is needed to align user capabilities with product functionalities, enhancing user experience by ensuring furniture systems are responsive and evolve with the users' needs. This would culminate in a comprehensive cloud-based system that supports both seniors and children in interacting with intelligent furniture.
